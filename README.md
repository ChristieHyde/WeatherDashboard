Users can type the name of a city into the search bar and submit to search for the most recent weather data for that city. The display will show a one-word summary for that city's conditions, along with an illustrative icon. The minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed and humidity are also shown, as well as the exact time the conditions were recorded.
The user can also view a 5-day forecast for that city, including average condition, minimum and maximum temperature, maximum wind speed and maximum humidity.

Previously searched cities are preserved in the sidebar underneath the search form. Clicking an item in this search history will retrieve the search results for that city.
